[cliqu.es](https://cliqu.es)
============================

This is the source for cliqu.es, a service for better user group management. (See the site for a brief intro)

I've been contributing less to it in the last fortnight and feel I've hit a brick wall. Any & all help, input, opinions etc appreciated. Take a look through the issues list for a rough roadmap. If you have an idea or something you'd like to see, open up an issue!

Dev notes:
----------

run `npm install` to grab dependencies, then `node .` to start the service.
